# Alpha Digital Forensics & Incident Response CTF Write-up

## üìÅ Project Overview

This repository contains the full digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) report for a simulated enterprise network compromise conducted as part of a capture-the-flag (CTF) challenge. The investigation centers on a targeted attack involving remote access, malware deployment, credential compromise, lateral movement, and data exfiltration.

This CTF scenario is based on [The Stolen Szechuan Sauce](https://dfirmadness.com/the-stolen-szechuan-sauce/) challenge from DFIRMadness, adapted for academic and training purposes.

## üéØ Scope of Investigation

The analysis focused on two Windows-based systems:
- **CITADEL-DC01**: Domain Controller (Windows Server 2012 R2)
- **DESKTOP-SDN1RPT**: Domain-joined client (Windows 10 Enterprise)

Investigators were provided with:
- Disk images (`.E01`)
- Memory dumps (`.mem`)
- Network packet captures (`.pcap`)

The goal was to trace attacker activity across hosts and identify key forensic artifacts left behind.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology

The investigation followed a full-spectrum DFIR workflow:
- **Disk Forensics**: MFT, USN Journal, Recycle Bin, Registry hives
- **Memory Analysis**: Volatility 2 & 3 for process injection, credential dumping, network connections
- **Network Forensics**: PCAP inspection with Wireshark and NetworkMiner
- **Timeline Reconstruction**: Super timelines using MFTECmd, Plaso, and Timeline Explorer
- **Malware Analysis**: Behavior profiling with VirusTotal, Any.Run, and Hybrid Analysis

All analysis was conducted in isolated environments with forensic integrity in mind.

## üîç Key Findings

- **Initial Access**: Brute-force RDP login using default Administrator credentials
- **Malware Execution**: `coreupdater.exe`, a Meterpreter reverse shell
- **Persistence**: Registry run keys and malicious services (`T1547.001`, `T1543.003`)
- **Lateral Movement**: RDP from DC to client using reused credentials (`T1021.001`)
- **Exfiltration**: ZIP archives extracted from memory artifacts and confirmed in PCAP traffic
- **Evasion**: File timestomping, process injection into `spoolsv.exe` (`T1070.006`, `T1055`)
- **Command & Control**: HTTPS traffic with known suspicious IP addresses
- **Threat Intel**: Infrastructure tied to Russian and Thai IPs, though no APT attribution confirmed
